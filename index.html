    Welcome to my page on Eshraan. Along the top, you will see a page for the universe’s background. It describes in detail how Earth and Eshraan came to be and why there was such a conflict between them. It’ll explain what Gates are and Crystals. Disclosure: this page will have spoilers and you will be required to verify that you are okay with reading these. The next page will include an in-depth explanation of the Eshraanite symbol and how I was inspired upon its creation. This page will also include spoilers and you will be required to verify that you acknowledge this.

    Lastly, I have included the entire text I have so far under the “Chapters” section. It is, as self-explained, broken up into each chapter. This text is tentative and is subject to change, however, as I build upon it. On the Chapters page, I have linked the Google Document from which I am writing my story. The website version won’t be updated as often as the document version, so if you’d like to read more than what the website has, check the document and I may have more text.

    Eshraan is a story that I started last year as a short story. I always loved writing stories and I figured why not make several short ones. But over time, the “short story” became an idea for a novel that grew foundations very quickly. After figuring out the basics of the plot, and how I want the story to go, I continued writing my story. Now, I figured out the basics of the plot, not everything. This is to prevent rambling and adding useless words while I try and figure out what to do next, while on the other hand, I can still “write on the fly” and let the characters develop themselves.
    </p><p>
    Overall, this process has been very fun. The power to create entire worlds, and fill them with whatever you want is absolutely invigorating. To develop your characters as they develop themselves. It’s a special opportunity for creativity to flow. To let your imagination run wild with galient tales of planets and magic and even telekinetic, telepathic, etc. powers. I myself think it’s more than fun to pretend you could possibly live in such a world, in one with magical crystals and gems, one where you can control physical object with just your mind, or send messages to someone without saying a word.

    Below is a blurb for my novel titled Eshraan.
    </p><p class="bold">
    Every night, it’s the same. Norman Grummell has been plagued with the same nightmare since he was young, and now that he’s fifteen, nothings changed. Until he moves. Moving has become an ordinary practice with his dad out of work, bouncing from school to school and town to town. But when Norman finds himself in Woodland Pikes, things get odd. More than odd, in fact, purely fantastical. He learns of an entire planet that the average person knows nothing about, one that is secretly on the brink of war with Earth. Through a series of incredible events, he finds himself set on avoiding this war, but little does he know, he may have more influence than he thought.
