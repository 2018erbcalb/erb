The symbol above is the astrological symbol for the planet Eshraan. As you can see on the right, it derives many features from the astrological symbol of Earth. Namely being the circle with a cross through its center. The Eshraan symbol is similar this in that it shares the same circle and cross, but without a quarter of the circle. This is designed to show how similar the two planets are, not only in landscape but also with inhabitants and even name. Where the missing quarter of the circle would have been is instead three dots. These dots are a variation of the orion’s belt constellation, which according to many theorists believe to be the origins of the “gods of egypt” and other sorts. I took this iconic constellation, where the aliens supposedly live, and implemented it into my symbol as if to say: this is where MY aliens are. But I couldn’t be too direct and copy the constellation exactly, or else that would not be very original. So, I changed the angle of the stars, and even though its subtle, its still an allusion, but not a direct reference. The “wifi” looking bands in the lower right quarter of the circle is to represent the ACCs that each Eshraan has. Long lost to the people of Earth, ACCs allow one to do telekinesis and telepathic things. I made a subtle reference to this with my wifi looking symbol. I figured since ACCs manipulate one’s surroundings without physically touching them, it would appear to be acting invisibly through the air. In fact, it might, we still don’t understand the sciences of telekinesis and cognitive abilities like the such. Because of this “invisibility through the air” quality, I thought it would be appropriate to implement a wifi band aspect to the symbol.

Overall, I think my symbol is a fair and accurate representation of the Eshraanite planet. Once I design my cover, I plan on making this symbol a key focal point on the cover to show how important the symbol is to represent the planet. In the picture to the right, I added a green/blue glow behind the symbol because it looks good. There was no meaning to that aspect however I’m sure if I thought real hard about it, I could come up with one.

<p>Here is a picture of the astrological symbol for Earth. As you can see, it shows a circle with a perpendicular cross inside of it. This design was utilized in my symbol for the Eshraan planet.</p>
