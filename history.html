<p>
Long before the Earth that we know today, humans lived on another planet. One called Takesh. Filled with green plant life and exotic animals, the people there thrived. With a red giant sun beating on the surface, they took shelter below the canopies of the large trees.
</p><p>
These people, called Takeshens, were much more advanced than we on Earth are today. Not only through technological venues, but also through biological ones. They had what they called ACCs, or Advanced Cerebral Capabilities. These today are broken up into smaller categories, like telekinesis, telepathy, and simply higher cognitive processing. These ACCs did take a toll on the body however; if one tried to overexert themselves, they could result in a coma or wind up dead. 
</p><p>
The geography of Takesh resulted in two major nations, one calling themselves Earth, and the other Eshraan. Both nations’ people got along fairly well, however the same could not be said for their leaders. The governments of the two were always bickering about small things, land disputes, trade and commerce, the typical things for government bodies to argue about. One day, however, something of Earth’s was stolen. A priceless historical artifact that, according to lore, had the power to commune with the gods. Naturally, Eshraan was blamed for this. Though they denied over and over again that they hadn’t taken it, Earth declared war with Eshraan. Eshraan had no choice but to defend themselves from the warring might of their sister nation. They battled for years, passing their conflict to their children to take up arms. 
</p><p>
After decades of war and destruction, the two nations had destroyed their protection from the red giant: the trees. With the atmosphere quickly boiling away, the people of Takesh fled to spacecraft to avoid the sweltering surface temperatures. They needed a new home, but Earth would not stand to live near thieves. And Eshraan could not live with liars. So they made their journey to separate planets, naming their new homes after their old nations. 
</p><p>
After years of settling into each others’ homes, the people of Eshraan made a monumental discovery. Buried deep beneath the surface of their new planet, were tiny amber crystal. Eshraanite scientists tested them to figure out what they were, and they discovered that the crystals have certain properties that enhance ACC brainwave function, without taxing the body’s resources nearly as much. This discovery, reluctantly, was shared with Earth through deep space communication. Earth proposed to share some of the gravitational generating gateways they had been developing in exchange for some of these crystals.
</p><p>
An agreement was struck: Earth would share their Gate technology and Eshraan would implement the crystals into the design, acting as a key. So that only those who had the crystals (the leaders of both planets) would be able to traverse to each other. No weapons may go through the gate and only one person. This restricts use of them to solely diplomatic purposes. 
</p><p>
Twelve crystals for each leader of Earth. Twelve for each leader of Eshraan. And one Gate for each crystal.
